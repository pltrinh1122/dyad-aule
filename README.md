# dyad-aule

A **dyad** — a human Operator + an agent, practising [The Dyad Practice](https://github.com/The-Dyad-Practice-Commons/the-dyad-practice).
Craft: **building software through intent.** Telos: *minimize the operator↔agent turns it takes to pin
down both what you want and how you'll know it's done right.* Value: **fidelity** — faithful to both
*real* (it does what it says) and *right* (it's what the Operator meant).

- **Machine entry point:** `CLAUDE.md` → **`DYAD.md`** (the loadable anchor: identity, craft, operating-policy).
- **Human entry point:** this file.
- **Registry:** [`commons/directory/dyad-aule.yaml`](commons/directory/dyad-aule.yaml) — our entry in the Commons.

## Repository layout — the single-home map

Each artifact-kind has exactly **one home**. A fact lives in one place; cross-references point, never copy.

| Path | Kind | Single home for |
|---|---|---|
| `DYAD.md` | anchor | who we are — identity, craft, operational + operating-policy invariants |
| `CLAUDE.md` | shim | the machine load instruction (`Read DYAD.md`) |
| `README.md` | front door | outsider orientation + the **organizational invariants** (below) |
| `check` | runner | the real-half check — runs every `criteria/` file |
| `criteria/` | checks | executable acceptance criteria (one file per task) |
| `bin/` | runtime | **dyad-rt** — the launcher (`claude`), physical wrappers (`git`, `gh`), and the boundary enforcer (`dyad-rt`) |
| `.githooks/` | runtime floor | git-hook hard floor (`pre-commit`, `pre-push`) — refuses main-mutations even on raw `git` |
| `retro/` | ledger | the convergence ledger (turns-per-slot, accelerators, turn-sinks) |
| `dialectic/` | reports | falsifiable reports & cross-dyad analysis (the published home for claims) |
| `dm/` | messages | outbound Dyad Messages, sender-hosted at `dm/<recipient>/` |
| `commons/` | form (submodule) | the shared Dyad-Practice Commons |

## Organizational invariants

Standing rules for how this repo is *organized* — each aligned with a mainstream software convention and,
where possible, **enforced by `./check`** (an invariant we only assert in prose is one we can drift from —
the exact failure our peers exhibit, where the anchor no longer matches the engine; see `dialectic/`).

| # | Invariant | Aligns with (industry) | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| **O1** | A human landing on the repo is oriented — root `README.md` is the front door. | README as canonical entry point | ✅ `check` — README present |
| **O2** | **Single home / DRY** — every fact has one authoritative home; references point, never duplicate. | single-source-of-truth / DRY | 🧭 discipline (this map is the only layout home) |
| **O3** | **Minimal, predictable root** — each artifact-kind has one directory; root holds only the anchor, entry points, and config. | separation of concerns; legible top-level | ✅ `check` — root allowlist, no stray files |
| **O4** | **Hygiene** — no secrets, build artifacts, scratch, or transient state committed; `.gitignore` enforces it. | `.gitignore` hygiene; no secrets in VCS | ✅ `check` — `.gitignore` present, no cruft tracked |
| **O5** | **Executable, remotely-grounded criteria** — acceptance criteria are runnable (`criteria/` + `./check`) and run in CI on every PR. | CI gates on PR; automated checks | ✅ `check` locally **+ CI on every PR** (`.github/workflows/check.yml`) — closes the local≠remote split-brain in `dialectic/` |
| **O6** | **Branch → PR → Operator-merge** — never commit to `main`; the Operator merges. | protected `main` + PR review | ✅ **dyad-rt** enforces it — `.githooks` floor (fires on raw `git`) + `bin/git`·`bin/gh` wrappers + `bin/dyad-rt` enforcer, proven by `criteria/dyad-rt.sh`; policy home stays `DYAD.md` → `op-durability`/`op-PR` |
| **O7** | **Public repo declares a license.** | `LICENSE` file on public repos | ✅ **`LICENSE`** — 0BSD (Zero-Clause BSD), the most permissive OSI-approved license (no attribution required) |

## Verify

```
./check          # runs every criteria/ file; exits non-zero + names what failed
```

`./check` is the real-half of our `craft_invariants`: acceptance criteria made executable. The *right* half
(does it match what the Operator meant?) stays an Operator judgment — sealed by the merge (O6).
